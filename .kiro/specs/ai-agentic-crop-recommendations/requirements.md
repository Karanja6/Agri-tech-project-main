# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will integrate an AI agentic system using the npm Gemini client to provide intelligent, conversational crop recommendations when users input nitrogen, phosphorous, and rainfall amounts. The AI agent will enhance the existing ML-based crop recommendation system by providing contextual advice, explanations, and interactive guidance based on soil conditions and environmental factors.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want to receive AI-powered crop recommendations by inputting my soil's nitrogen, phosphorous, and rainfall data, so that I can get intelligent suggestions with explanations and reasoning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user inputs nitrogen, phosphorous, and rainfall values THEN the system SHALL call the Gemini AI API to generate contextual crop recommendations
2. WHEN the AI processes the input data THEN the system SHALL provide crop suggestions with detailed explanations and reasoning
3. WHEN the recommendation is generated THEN the system SHALL display both the AI recommendation and the existing ML model prediction for comparison
4. IF the input values are missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to provide valid numeric values

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want to have a conversational interface with the AI agent, so that I can ask follow-up questions about the recommendations and get personalized farming advice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user receives an initial recommendation THEN the system SHALL provide an option to ask follow-up questions
2. WHEN a user asks a follow-up question THEN the AI agent SHALL maintain context from the previous interaction
3. WHEN the AI responds THEN the system SHALL provide relevant farming advice based on the user's specific conditions
4. WHEN the conversation continues THEN the system SHALL store the conversation history for the current session

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want the AI to consider additional environmental factors beyond NPK values, so that I can receive more comprehensive and accurate recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN available THEN the AI SHALL incorporate weather data from the existing weather API
2. WHEN soil pH data is available THEN the AI SHALL include pH considerations in recommendations
3. WHEN temperature and humidity data exist THEN the AI SHALL factor these into crop suitability analysis
4. IF additional environmental data is missing THEN the AI SHALL provide recommendations based on available data and suggest what additional information would improve accuracy

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want the AI recommendations to be integrated seamlessly with the existing UI, so that I can access both traditional ML predictions and AI insights in one place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Get ML Recommendation" THEN the system SHALL display both ML and AI recommendations side by side
2. WHEN the AI recommendation loads THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator during processing
3. WHEN both recommendations are available THEN the system SHALL highlight any agreements or differences between them
4. WHEN an error occurs with the AI service THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to showing only the ML recommendation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the AI integration to be secure and cost-effective, so that the service remains sustainable and protects user data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API calls to Gemini THEN the system SHALL use secure API key management
2. WHEN processing user data THEN the system SHALL not store sensitive information in AI conversation logs
3. WHEN API rate limits are approached THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate throttling mechanisms
4. IF the AI service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue to function with the existing ML recommendations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want to receive actionable farming advice along with crop recommendations, so that I can understand not just what to plant but how to optimize my farming practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN providing crop recommendations THEN the AI SHALL include specific farming tips for the recommended crops
2. WHEN soil conditions are suboptimal THEN the AI SHALL suggest improvement strategies
3. WHEN seasonal factors are relevant THEN the AI SHALL provide timing recommendations for planting and harvesting
4. WHEN multiple crops are suitable THEN the AI SHALL explain the trade-offs and benefits of each option
